# BaconAI_1.5
I'm still rolling out updates everyday for this Script :)
# Features
✅ Added Bad Word Filtering – Now detects inappropriate words and replaces them with #.
✅ Bypass Protection – If a player tries to say a bad word differently (like "d!ck"), it'll still be caught.
✅ Bot Refuses to Respond to Inappropriate Messages – Instead, it replies:
"Sorry, I can't respond to that inappropriate message."
✅ Fully Functioning Chat System – You can now chat naturally while staying safe from toxic messages.
